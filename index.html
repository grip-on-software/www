						</header>
						<p>
							The Grip on Software (GROS) project performs a
							scientifically grounded research into the effects 
							and effectiveness of various practices within 
							software development processes. Specifically, we 
							focus on investigating the use of Scrum and other 
							agile software development methods, and study the 
							efficacy of events and of actions that take place 
							during the development cycle, such as code changes 
							and team meetings, and forecast the outcome of the 
							process or detailed divisions of it, including the 
							successful release of the product.
						</p>
						<p>
							The GROS project is a collaboration between the
							<a href="https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/">
							Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science 
							(LIACS)</a>, as part of
							<a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/">
							Leiden University</a>, and
							<a href="https://www.ictu.nl/">Stichting ICTU</a>, 
							an independent government-owned organization in the 
							Netherlands.<br>
							Research in large-scale data analytics of software 
							development is increasingly important because such 
							projects are often high-risk with funding of public 
							money and application of novel technologies, and 
							many end-users of citizens may be be impacted by 
							the success or failure of the project. Many factors 
							play a role in the quality, reliability, usability, 
							security, and effectiveness aspects of the 
							developed product, which are measurable during the 
							advancement of the developed product increments.

							We first model the software development ecosystem

							stages and transitions. This flexible yet specific 
							model explains the behavior we observe in the 
							process and allows for comparisons with existing 
							frameworks as well as perform model validation 
							using models from other applications that share 
							some intrinsic similarities, such as predator-prey 
							models, arrangements of factory pipelines, and 
							(self-)learning environments.
						</p>
						<p>
							These models provide us with insights and different 
							viewpoints of the inner workings of agile software 
							development practices, such as Scrum, Lean and 
							extreme programming, and form the basis for 
							extracting information from the process.

						</header>
						<p>
							Software development projects have their own unique 
							set of instances of tools used during the process, 
							where there is usually a core selection of systems 
							there are essential to the process, regardless of 
							methodology. These tools are version control 
							systems, e.g.,
							<a href="https://git-scm.com/"><i class="fab fa-git-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> Git</a> or
							<a href="https://subversion.apache.org/">
							<i class="fas fa-feather-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i>
							Subversion</a>, potentially combined with
							a built-in code review and tracking utility 
							provided by services like
							<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/"><i class="fab fa-gitlab" aria-hidden="true"></i> GitLab</a>,
							<a href="https://github.com/"><i class="fab fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> GitHub</a> and
							<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/server/">
							<i class="fab fa-microsoft" aria-hidden="true"></i>
							Azure DevOps Server</a>
							(formerly <a
							href="https://www.visualstudio.com/tfs/"
							title="Team Foundation Server">TFS</a>
							and <a
		  					href="https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/"
		 					title="Visual Studio Team Services">VSTS</a>).
							User stories, bug reports and technical backlogs 
							are often managed separately using project tracking 
							software such as
							<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">
							<i class="fab fa-jira" aria-hidden="true"></i>
							Jira</a>. Inspection of software quality is
							provided by platforms such as
							<a href="https://www.sonarqube.org/"><i class="fas fa-rss" aria-hidden="true"></i> SonarQube</a>, 
							and automated build and continuous integration 
							pipelines are served by systems like
							<a href="https://jenkins.io/"><i class="fab fa-jenkins" aria-hidden="true"></i> Jenkins</a>. 
							Additional project registration systems for 
							authorization control and meeting reservations also 
							play a role.
						</p>
						<p>
							We consider all of these tools as feasible sources 
							of information for our research, because they each 
							provide disclosure of specific parts of the 
							development process. Many tools store the complete 
							record of actions taken within the timeline of the 
							process for the purpose of referencing or auditing 
							these actions at a later moment. Some tools provide 
							limited aggregation of their own data, such as burn 
							down charts, but these are always restricted to the
							data available within the tool itself.

						<p>
							We construct the GROS data acquisition pipeline,
							an automated data pipeline to extract metrics,
							events and metadata from these systems and tools,
							which combines the data sources and links relevant
							events where possible. This database forms the basis
							for a data set of features, which we used for
							machine learning and information visualization.

								<span>Security</span>
							</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Privacy and security play an important role during 
							the entire research project. All data is stored on 
							secured servers with full disk encryption, and the 
							transfer of data only occurs on secure networks or 
							through the use of HTTPS and GPG encryption.<br>
							Personal information is treated specially. The 
							names of the people that are involved in a software 
							development process, including the project leaders, 
							clients and developers themselves, are obfuscated 
							using one-way encryption immediately when the data 
							is collected. This means that one can only 
							determine whether someone is involved in a project 
							if the attacker already has the personal 
							information as well as the original encryption key, 
							which always remains at the source location.
						</p>
						<p>
							We collect personal information only to uniquely 
							identify the same actor across development 
							platforms used within the same project. Standard 
							obfuscation techniques would be insufficient for 
							this purpose. Our intention is to provide feedback 
							of results on a project level, but details about 
							actor roles may still help in this aspect.
						</p>
						<p>
							The raw data is only handled by researchers of the 
							GROS project after certificates of good conduct, 
							non-disclosure agreements and privacy impact 
							assessments have been produced or signed. Personal 
							data and project-sensitive information is never 
							shared with anyone outside of the project.

							</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Our goal is to determine how we can effectively and
							accurately make use of the factors that strongly
							determine the success or failure of a software
							development process, using multiple means to measure
							these factors and the success factor, and finally
							to automate a system that provides a recommendation
							regarding the risk and how to reduce it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Since there exist different kinds of development
							processes with different means of determining
							the risk during the lifespan of a project, we focus
							on a group of methodologies known as Agile software
							development. In particular, we look at the Scrum
							framework which makes use of short time frames known
							as sprints, where developers commit to a number of
							goals that they think are reachable during this
							time, and implement the desired features
							corresponding to those goals. This provides us with
							a large set of historical information of sets
							of measurable events, as well as some feedback
							about whether the developers and the client was
							satisfied with the process and the delivered product
							increment.
						</p>
						<p>
							We focus on determining whether the developers reach
							all of their goals completely within the allotted
							time, through the use of various machine learning
							algorithms which learn from past sprints and provide
							an indication of the risk. We also estimate the
							effort required to undertake the user stories and
							other goals at hand. This allows us to find what
							kinds of properties are relevant to reaching the
							goals with more certainty.
