						</header>
						<p>
							The Grip on Software (GROS) project performs a
							scientifically grounded research into the effects
							and effectiveness of various practices within
							software development processes. Specifically, we
							focus on investigating the use of
							<span class="sc">Scrum</span>, an Agile software
							development method. We study the efficacy of events
							and of actions that take place during the
							development cycle, including code changes and team
							meetings. Finally, we forecast the outcome of the
							process or detailed divisions of it, including the
							successful release of the product.
						</p>
						<p>
							The GROS project is a collaboration between the
							<a href="https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/">
							Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science
							(LIACS)</a>&mdash;as part of
							<a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en">
							Leiden University</a>&mdash;and
							<a href="https://www.ictu.nl/about-us">Stichting
							ICTU</a>, an independent government-owned
							organization in the Netherlands.<br>
							Research in large-scale data analytics of software
							development is increasingly important because such
							projects are often high-risk with funding of public
							money and application of novel technologies.
							Furthermore, many end-users of citizens may be
							impacted by the success or failure of the project.
							Many factors  play a role in the quality
							reliability, usability, security and effectiveness
							aspects of the developed product, which are
							measurable during the advancement of the developed
							product increments.

						<p>
							We first model the software development ecosystem
							as a whole, including actors, information sources,
							stages and transitions. This flexible yet specific
							model explains the behavior we observe in the
							process and allows for comparisons with existing
							frameworks as well as perform model validation
							using models from other applications that share
							some intrinsic similarities, such as predator-prey
							models, arrangements of factory pipelines and
							(self-)learning environments.
						</p>
						<p>
							These models provide us with insights and different
							viewpoints of the inner workings of agile software
							development practices, such as
							<span class="sc">Scrum</span>, Lean and
							extreme programming. This forms the basis for
							extracting information from the process.

						<p>
							Software development projects have their own unique
							set of instances of tools used during the process,
							where there is usually a core selection of systems
							there are essential to the process, regardless of
							methodology. These tools are version control
							systems, e.g.,
							<a href="https://git-scm.com/"><i class="fab fa-git-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> Git</a> or
							<a href="https://subversion.apache.org/">
							<i class="fas fa-feather-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i>
							Subversion</a>, potentially combined with
							a built-in code review and tracking utility
							provided by services like
							<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/"><i class="fab fa-gitlab" aria-hidden="true"></i> GitLab</a>,
							<a href="https://github.com/"><i class="fab fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i> GitHub</a> and
							<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/server/">
							<i class="fab fa-microsoft" aria-hidden="true"></i>
							Azure DevOps Server</a>
							(formerly <a
							href="https://www.visualstudio.com/tfs/"
							title="Team Foundation Server">TFS</a>
							and <a
							href="https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/"
							title="Visual Studio Team Services">VSTS</a>).
							User stories, bug reports and technical backlogs
							are often managed separately using project tracking
							software such as
							<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">
							<i class="fab fa-jira" aria-hidden="true"></i>
							Jira</a>. Inspection of software quality is
							provided by platforms such as
							<a href="https://www.sonarqube.org/"><i class="fas fa-rss" aria-hidden="true"></i> SonarQube</a>.
							Automated build and continuous integration
							pipelines are served by systems like
							<a href="https://jenkins.io/"><i class="fab fa-jenkins" aria-hidden="true"></i> Jenkins</a>.
							Additional project registration systems for
							authorization control and meeting reservations also
							play a role.
						</p>
						<p>
							We consider all of these tools as feasible sources
							of information for our research, because they each
							provide disclosure of specific parts of the
							development process. Many tools store the complete
							record of actions taken within the timeline of the
							process for the purpose of referencing or auditing
							these actions at a later moment. Some tools provide
							limited aggregation of their own data, such as burn
							down charts, but these are always restricted to the
							data available within the tool itself.

With an R/SQL based analysis program, we extract features for visualization with D3.js and for prediction with TensorFlow models.">
						</figure>
						<p>
							We construct the GROS data acquisition pipeline,
							an automated data pipeline to extract metrics,
							events and metadata from these systems and tools,
							which combines the data sources and links relevant
							events where possible. This database forms the basis
							for a data set of features, which we used for
							machine learning and information visualization.

								<span>Security</span>
							</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Privacy and security play an important role during
							the entire research project. All data is stored on
							secured servers with full disk encryption. The
							transfer of data only occurs in secure networks or
							through the use of HTTPS and GPG encryption.<br>
							Personal information is treated specially. The
							names of the people that are involved in a software
							development process, including the project leaders,
							clients and developers themselves, are obfuscated
							using one-way encryption immediately when the data
							is collected. This means that one can only
							determine whether someone is involved in a project
							if the attacker already has the personal
							information as well as the original encryption key,
							which always remains at the source location.
						</p>
						<p>
							We collect personal information only to uniquely
							identify the same actor across development
							platforms used within the same project. Standard
							obfuscation techniques would be insufficient for
							this purpose. Our intention is to provide feedback
							of results on a project level, but details about
							actor roles may still help in this aspect.
						</p>
						<p>
							The raw data is only handled by researchers of the
							GROS project after certificates of good conduct,
							non-disclosure agreements and privacy impact
							assessments have been produced or signed. Personal
							data and project-sensitive information is never
							shared with anyone outside of the project.

								<span>Prediction</span>
							</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Our goal is to determine how we can effectively and
							accurately make use of the factors that strongly
							determine the success or failure of a software
							development process, using multiple means to measure
							these factors and the success factor. Finally, the
							aim is to design and implement an automated system
							that provides a recommendation regarding the risk,
							explains how the risk was measured and provides
							recommendations on how to reduce this risk.
						</p>
						<p>
							Since there exist different kinds of development
							processes with different means of determining
							the risk during the lifespan of a project, we focus
							on a group of methodologies known as Agile software
							development. In particular, we look at the
							<span class="sc">Scrum</span> framework, which
							makes use of short time frames known as sprints,
							where developers commit to a number of goals that
							they think are reachable during this time. The
							developers then commit to implementing the desired
							features corresponding to those goals. This
							provides us with a large set of historical
							information of measurable events at various time
							ranges, as well as some feedback about whether the
							developers and the client was satisfied with the
							process and the delivered product increment.
						</p>
						<p>
							We focus on determining whether the developers reach
							all of their goals completely within the allotted
							time, through the use of various machine learning
							algorithms which learn from past sprints and provide
							an indication of the risk. We also estimate the
							effort required to undertake the user stories and
							other goals at hand. This allows us to find what
							kinds of properties are relevant to reaching the
							goals with more certainty.
						</p>
						<p>
							Detailed information regarding the predictions of
							upcoming sprints are provided in an overview
							dashboard, through the use of
							<a href="#visualization">information
							visualizations</a>. The data set used for
							training, testing and validating the models that
							provide the risk classification and estimations
							based on similar sprints are also
							<a href="#technical">made available</a> for
							further scientific inquiry.
